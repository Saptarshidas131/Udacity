    <h1>The World Wide Web</h1>

    <h2>Components of the Web</h2>
    <p>The major pieces are you, your computer running a <b>web browser</b>, the <b>Internet</b>, and <b>servers</b>.
    Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers. These requests are using a protocol called HTTP.
    And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.
    Some examples of browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. You're probably running one of those right this moment.
    These servers are computers just like yours except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than sitting on your desk browsing these files.
    And the protocol HTTP is just a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with these servers.
    We'll mostly be focusing on the browser component in this section for rendering HTML files.</p>
